<h2>Info</h2>

<p>This is the info page of this basic Webpage. This really just provides the info of the webpage and the developer. It was developed by Joe J Garrepy (a pretty awesome dude) who some may also know as Big Fish.  I made this because I wanted to 
    learn how to use html and node js (also because im very board)</p>
